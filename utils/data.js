  "If you think about it, time is just a really elaborate way of keeping everything from happening at once.",
  "The idea of a 'skeleton key' is kind of ironic because a skeleton is essentially a key to a person's identity.",

  "The fact that we have a day designated for trick-or-treating but not for giving thanks says a lot about our society.",

  "What if our dreams are actually alternate realities we visit while we sleep?",
